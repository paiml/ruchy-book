## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Every Sprint Must:
1. ✅ Write tests BEFORE documentation
2. ✅ Achieve 100% test pass rate
3. ✅ Update INTEGRATION.md
4. ✅ Pass all quality gates
5. ✅ No untested features

### Every Chapter Must:
1. ✅ Have minimum 3 tested examples
2. ✅ Include test file references
3. ✅ Show how to verify examples
4. ✅ Document only what works
5. ✅ Include version compatibility

## 🚫 What We DON'T Do

### Never:
- ❌ Document untested features
- ❌ Write "should work" examples
- ❌ Promise future functionality
- ❌ Include TODO/FIXME comments
- ❌ Skip quality gates

### Always:
- ✅ Test first, document second
- ✅ Verify with actual compiler
- ✅ Update INTEGRATION.md
- ✅ Maintain 100% pass rate
- ✅ Follow Toyota Way

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Completed Sprints
- ✅ Sprint 1: Infrastructure (TDD setup)
- ✅ Sprint 2: Foundation Tests (11 examples)
- ✅ Sprint 3: Foundation Docs (3 chapters)

### Current Sprint
- 🔄 Sprint 4: Control Flow (starting)

### Upcoming Sprints
- ⏳ Sprint 5: Data Structures
- ⏳ Sprint 6: Ownership
- ⏳ Sprint 7-12: See timeline above

## 🤝 Community Involvement

### How to Contribute
1. Pick an untested chapter
2. Write tests for features
3. Verify they pass with v1.1.0
4. Submit PR with tests
5. Documentation follows after review

### Contribution Requirements
- Must follow TDD process
- Must pass `make test`
- Must update INTEGRATION.md
- Must use Ruchy v1.1.0+
- Must have 100% pass rate

## 📝 Notes

### Why TDD?
- Previous approach: 93% failure rate (261/280 broken)
- TDD approach: 100% success rate (11/11 working)
- Difference: Test first vs document first

### Key Lessons
1. Never document untested features
2. Always verify with real compiler
3. Version compatibility is critical
4. Quality gates prevent regression
5. Single source of truth essential
