# The Ruchy Programming Language Book - ROADMAP

## 🎯 Current Sprint: v1.26.0+ Coverage Excellence Sprint

**Sprint Goal**: Achieve 100% test coverage on ALL book examples
**Previous Achievement**: 83% pass rate with zero SATD ✅
**Current Status**: Pass rate achieved, coverage unknown
**Target Status**: 100% test coverage using `ruchy test --coverage`
**Sprint Duration**: 1 day
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL

## Coverage Requirements
- **Mandatory**: Every example must achieve 100% line coverage
- **Tool**: Use latest ruchy build with working coverage feature
- **Threshold**: 100% (no exceptions for book examples)
- **Verification**: Automated coverage checking in CI

## Core Principles
- **NO SATD**: Zero placeholder examples, zero TODO comments
- **TDD Only**: Test-first development, all code must pass tests
- **PMAT Verification**: Use PMAT for quality scoring
- **No Vaporware**: Only document what works TODAY

- ❌ Include TODO/FIXME comments
- ❌ Skip quality gates

### Always:
- ✅ Test first, document second
- ✅ Verify with actual compiler
- ✅ Update INTEGRATION.md
- ✅ Maintain 100% pass rate
- ✅ Follow Toyota Way

## 🤝 Community Involvement

### How to Contribute
1. Pick an untested chapter
2. Write tests for features
3. Verify they pass with v1.1.0
4. Submit PR with tests
5. Documentation follows after review

### Contribution Requirements
- Must follow TDD process
- Must pass `make test`
- Must update INTEGRATION.md
- Must use Ruchy v1.1.0+
- Must have 100% pass rate

## 📝 Notes

### Why TDD?
- Previous approach: 93% failure rate (261/280 broken)
- TDD approach: 100% success rate (11/11 working)
- Difference: Test first vs document first

### Key Lessons
1. Never document untested features
2. Always verify with real compiler
3. Version compatibility is critical
4. Quality gates prevent regression
5. Single source of truth essential
