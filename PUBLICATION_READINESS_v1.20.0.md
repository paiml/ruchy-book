### Quality Assurance Process
```bash
# Publication Quality Pipeline:
1. ruchy test chapters/ --coverage --threshold=90
2. ruchy lint chapters/ --fix --strict  
3. ruchy score chapters/ --min=0.85
4. ruchy prove chapters/ --check --mathematical-examples
```

## üìö Chapter-by-Chapter Readiness

### Ready for Publication (High Confidence)
- **Chapter 1-3**: Basic language features - **EXCELLENT** working example rate
- **Chapter 4-6**: Functions and control flow - **GOOD** coverage with quality examples
- **Chapter 7-9**: Data structures - **COMPREHENSIVE** examples with modern patterns
- **Chapter 10-12**: Advanced features - **SOLID** foundation examples working

### Requires Review (Medium Confidence)  
- **Chapter 13-15**: System programming - Some syntax evolution issues
- **Chapter 16-18**: Advanced patterns - Modern syntax compatibility needed
- **Chapter 19-21**: Project examples - Focus on working subset

### Enhancement Opportunities (Low Priority)
- **Appendices**: Reference material - Can be published as-is with disclaimers
- **Troubleshooting**: Practical content - Working examples provide good coverage

## üîß Quality Maintenance Workflow

### Pre-Publication Quality Gates
```bash
#!/bin/bash  
# book-quality-gates.sh
set -e

echo "üìö Ruchy Book Quality Gates..."

# Gate 1: Working Examples Test
ruchy test working-examples/ --coverage --threshold=95 || {
    echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Working examples test failure"
    exit 1
}

# Gate 2: Code Quality Standards
ruchy lint working-examples/ --strict --deny-warnings || {
    echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Code quality issues detected"  
    exit 1
}

# Gate 3: Quality Score Requirement
ruchy score working-examples/ --min=0.85 || {
    echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Quality score below publication standard"
    exit 1
}

# Gate 4: Mathematical Verification (Advisory)  
ruchy prove working-examples/ --check --timeout=30000 || {
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Some examples lack mathematical verification"
}

echo "‚úÖ Publication quality gates passed"
```
