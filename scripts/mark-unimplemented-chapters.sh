## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Feature Not Yet Implemented

**$feature is a planned feature for Ruchy $target_version**. This chapter describes the intended design but **none of these examples currently work**.

## What You Can Do Today

Instead of waiting for this feature, you can:
- Use the working features documented in TDD chapters
- Contribute to the implementation at [github.com/paiml/ruchy](https://github.com/paiml/ruchy)
- See the [roadmap](../appendix-roadmap.md) for timeline
