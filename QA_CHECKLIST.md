## 🧪 TDD Quality Assurance Protocol

Every change to this book MUST follow Test-Driven Development. No exceptions.

## ✅ Pre-Documentation Checklist (MANDATORY)

Before writing ANY documentation:

### 1. Test Creation
- [ ] Test file created in `tests/ch*/` directory
- [ ] Test follows naming convention: `test_XX_description.ruchy`
- [ ] Test uses `fun main()` structure
- [ ] Test uses `fun` keyword (not `fn`)
- [ ] Test is minimal and focused

### 2. Test Verification
- [ ] `ruchy compile test_file.ruchy` succeeds
- [ ] `./a.out` produces expected output
- [ ] `make test-file FILE=test_file.ruchy` passes
- [ ] No compilation warnings or errors
- [ ] Output matches documentation claims

### 3. Test Integration
- [ ] Added to appropriate chapter test directory
- [ ] Included in `make test-chXX` target
- [ ] Passes `make test` (all tests)
- [ ] Passes `make lint` (quality checks)
- [ ] Listed in INTEGRATION.md

## 📝 Documentation Checklist

After tests pass, documentation must:

### 1. Accuracy
- [ ] Every code example has corresponding test file
- [ ] Test file path referenced in documentation
- [ ] Output shown matches actual test output

- [ ] No untested features documented

### 2. Structure
- [ ] Chapter marked as "Test-Driven"
- [ ] Test count shown in header
- [ ] "How to verify" section included
- [ ] Test files referenced by path
- [ ] Make commands documented

### 3. Quality
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments

## 📞 Escalation Path

If quality gates fail:

1. **Stop all work** - Don't continue with failures
2. **Fix immediately** - Tests must pass first
3. **Document issue** - Update INTEGRATION.md
4. **Review process** - Why did it fail?
5. **Prevent recurrence** - Update this checklist

---
