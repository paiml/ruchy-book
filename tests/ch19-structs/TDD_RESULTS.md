# TDD Results for Struct Features in Ruchy v3.52.0

## Test-Driven Development Approach

Following TRUE TDD methodology:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests first
2. **GREEN**: Make tests pass (or document if feature not implemented)
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up and document

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ PASSING Tests (Features that work)

#### test_01_basic_struct.ruchy
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING
- **Features**: Basic struct definition, field access
- **Evidence**: Compiles and runs successfully

#### test_03_field_mutation_tdd.ruchy
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING
- **Features**: Field mutation with `mut` structs
- **Evidence**: Can modify struct fields after creation

### ❌ FAILING Tests (Features not yet implemented)

#### test_02_nested_structs.ruchy
- **Status**: ❌ FAILING
- **Issue**: Nested field access (obj.field.subfield) generates incorrect transpilation
- **Error**: `error: expected one of , or >, found ==`
- **Workaround**: Use intermediate variables

#### test_04_struct_methods_tdd.ruchy
- **Status**: ❌ PARTIAL FAILURE
- **Issue**: impl blocks compile but have ownership problems
- **Error**: `error[E0382]: use of moved value: rect1`
- **Note**: Methods take ownership, no borrowing support yet

#### test_05_struct_equality_tdd.ruchy
- **Status**: ❌ FAILING
- **Issue**: No automatic PartialEq implementation
- **Error**: `error[E0369]: binary operation == cannot be applied to type Point`
- **Note**: Needs derive(PartialEq) support

## Features Matrix

| Feature | Test Written | Test Status | Production Ready |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Basic struct definition | ✅ | ✅ PASS | ✅ Yes |
| Field access | ✅ | ✅ PASS | ✅ Yes |
| Field mutation | ✅ | ✅ PASS | ✅ Yes |
| Nested structs | ✅ | ❌ FAIL | ❌ No |
| Nested field access | ✅ | ❌ FAIL | ❌ No |
| Impl blocks | ✅ | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ⚠️ Limited |
| Struct methods | ✅ | ❌ FAIL (ownership) | ❌ No |
| Equality comparison | ✅ | ❌ FAIL | ❌ No |

## Recommendations for Documentation

Based on TDD results, only document:
1. Basic struct definition and instantiation
2. Simple field access (non-nested)
3. Field mutation with mut
4. Limitations and workarounds for other features

## Next Steps for Compiler Team

Priority fixes based on TDD failures:
1. Fix nested field access transpilation
2. Add borrowing/reference support for methods
3. Implement automatic derive(PartialEq)
4. Fix ownership issues in impl blocks
