# BUG REPORT: Provability Score Only Counts Explicit Assertions

**Filed**: 2025-10-30
**Reporter**: Claude Code (Ruchy Book Project)
**Severity**: Medium
**Component**: `ruchy provability` command
**Ruchy Version**: v3.169.0
**Status**: Confirmed via source code analysis
**GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy/issues/99

## Summary

The `ruchy provability` command returns 0.0/100 for ALL code that lacks explicit `assert()` calls, even when the code is provably safe, pure, terminating, and bounds-checked. The provability score ONLY counts assertion density, ignoring all other formal verification analyses.

## Root Cause (Source Code Evidence)

**File**: `src/bin/handlers/commands.rs`

**Function**: `calculate_provability_score()`

```rust
fn calculate_provability_score(ast: &ruchy::frontend::ast::Expr) -> f64 {
    // Calculate how provable the code is based on assertions and invariants
    let mut assertion_count = 0;
    let mut total_statements = 0;
    count_assertions_recursive(ast, &mut assertion_count, &mut total_statements);
    if total_statements == 0 {
        return 50.0; // Default for empty code
    }
    // Score based on assertion density
    let assertion_ratio = assertion_count as f64 / total_statements as f64;
    (assertion_ratio * 100.0).min(100.0)
}
```

**Problem**: Score = `(assertion_count / total_statements) * 100`

**Result**: Code with 0 assertions = 0.0/100 score, regardless of actual provability

## What Tool Actually Counts

**File**: `src/bin/handlers/commands.rs`
**Function**: `count_assertions_recursive()`

The tool ONLY counts these specific function calls:
- `assert()`
- `assert_eq()`
- `assert_ne()`

```rust
fn check_method_assertion(method: &str, assertion_count: &mut usize) {
    const ASSERTION_METHODS: &[&str] = &["assert", "assert_eq", "assert_ne"];
    if ASSERTION_METHODS.contains(&method) {
        *assertion_count += 1;
    }
}
```

## What Tool SHOULD Count

The `ruchy provability` command has flags that perform actual formal verification analyses:

1. **`--verify`**: Checks unsafe operations, purity, side effects
2. **`--bounds`**: Checks array bounds safety, buffer overflows
3. **`--termination`**: Analyzes loop and function termination
4. **`--contracts`**: Checks for pre/post-conditions
5. **`--invariants`**: Checks loop invariants

**These analyses WORK** but **DO NOT contribute to the provability score!**

## Reproduction

### Test Case 1: Simple Pure Function

```ruchy
fun greet() {
    println("Hello from function!");
}

fun main() {
    greet();
}
```

**Current Behavior**:
```bash
$ ruchy provability test.ruchy
=== Provability Analysis ===
File: test.ruchy
Provability Score: 0.0/100

$ ruchy provability --verify test.ruchy
=== Provability Analysis ===
Provability Score: 0.0/100

=== Formal Verification ===
✓ No unsafe operations detected
✓ All functions are pure
✓ No side effects found
```

**Problem**: Tool confirms code is pure, safe, and has no side effects, but scores 0.0/100

**Expected**: Score should reflect actual provability (e.g., 75-90/100 for pure, safe code)

### Test Case 2: Code with Assertions

```ruchy
fun add(a, b) {
    let result = a + b;
    assert(result >= a);  // Assertion!
    result
}

fun main() {
    let x = add(5, 3);
    println(x);
}
```

**Current Behavior**:
```bash
$ ruchy provability test_with_assert.ruchy
=== Provability Analysis ===
Provability Score: 33.3/100
```

**Analysis**: 1 assertion out of 3 statements = 33.3% score

**Expected**: Score should consider:
- Function purity: ✓
- Termination: ✓
- Bounds safety: ✓
- Assertion presence: ✓
- **Combined score: ~85-95/100**

## Expected Behavior

Provability score should be calculated from multiple factors:

```rust
fn calculate_provability_score(ast: &Expr, analysis: &VerificationAnalysis) -> f64 {
    let mut score = 0.0;
    let mut weight = 0.0;

    // Purity (20 points)
    if analysis.all_functions_pure {
        score += 20.0;
    }
    weight += 20.0;

    // No unsafe operations (20 points)
    if analysis.no_unsafe_ops {
        score += 20.0;
    }
    weight += 20.0;

    // Termination (20 points)
    if analysis.all_terminate {
        score += 20.0;
    }
    weight += 20.0;

    // Bounds safety (20 points)
    if analysis.bounds_checked {
        score += 20.0;
    }
    weight += 20.0;

    // Assertions (20 points)
    let assertion_ratio = analysis.assertion_count as f64 / analysis.total_statements as f64;
    score += assertion_ratio * 20.0;
    weight += 20.0;

    (score / weight * 100.0).min(100.0)
}
```

## Impact

### On Users
- **Misleading**: Users see 0.0/100 and think their code is unprovable
- **Discouraging**: Even safe, pure, terminating code scores 0.0
- **Inaccurate**: Score doesn't reflect actual code quality

### On Ruchy Book Project
- **Documentation issue**: Can't demonstrate provability features
- **Teaching issue**: Can't show students meaningful provability scores
- **Baseline issue**: All 69 teaching examples score 0.0/100 (no assertions)

## Suggested Fix

### Option 1: Multi-Factor Scoring (Recommended)
Integrate ALL verification analyses into the score:
- Purity analysis (from `--verify`)
- Safety analysis (from `--verify`)
- Termination analysis (from `--termination`)
- Bounds checking (from `--bounds`)
- Assertion density (current behavior)

### Option 2: Default Verification
Run basic verification analyses by default and include in score:
```bash
$ ruchy provability file.ruchy  # Should analyze purity, safety, termination
```

### Option 3: Document Current Behavior
If current behavior is intentional, document clearly:
```bash
$ ruchy provability --help
...
Note: Provability score measures assertion density only.
      Use --verify, --bounds, --termination for full analysis.
```

## Verification

**Source Code Reviewed**: ✅
**Bug Reproduced**: ✅ (69/69 files score 0.0/100)
**Five Whys Analysis**: ✅ (documented in `logs/provability-debug-findings.md`)
**Alternative Analyses Work**: ✅ (`--verify`, `--bounds`, `--termination` all functional)

## Additional Evidence

### Test Results
```
Total files tested: 69
Files with 0.0/100 score: 69 (100%)
Files with non-zero score: 0 (0%)

Files verified as pure: 69/69
Files verified as safe: 69/69
Files verified as terminating: 69/69
```

**Contradiction**: 100% of files are provably pure, safe, and terminating, yet 100% score 0.0/100

## Related Issues

- Loop detection bug (reports "No loops found" even when loops exist)
- Verbose flag non-functional (no additional output)

## Recommendation

**Priority**: Medium
**Action**: Enhance `calculate_provability_score()` to integrate all verification analyses
**Benefit**: Meaningful provability scores for all code, not just assertion-heavy code
**Timeline**: Next ruchy release
