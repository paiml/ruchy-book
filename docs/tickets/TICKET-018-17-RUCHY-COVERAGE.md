# TICKET-018-17: Integrate `ruchy coverage` - Coverage Reporting

**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2025-10-30
**Priority**: P1 (High Priority - Phase 1B)
**Parent**: TICKET-018 (Comprehensive 18-Tool Testing)
**Phase**: Phase 1B (Compilation & Testing) - 3/3
**Predecessor**: TICKET-018-05 (ruchy test - COMPLETE, 100% accuracy)
**Estimated Effort**: 40 minutes (pattern acceleration)
**Ruchy Version**: v3.169.0

## Executive Summary

Integrate `ruchy coverage` reporting into the comprehensive testing pipeline. This is the sixth of 18 tools and the final tool in Phase 1B (Compilation & Testing). This validates that coverage analysis works correctly and reports meaningful metrics. Expected complexity: Low-Medium (depends on coverage tool maturity and test function existence).

## Current State

### What `ruchy coverage` Does

The `ruchy coverage` command analyzes test coverage:
- Reports line coverage percentages
- Identifies covered vs uncovered code paths
- May require test functions to generate coverage
- Provides metrics for code quality assessment
- Typically runs with test execution

**Output**: Coverage report (percentages, covered/uncovered lines)

### Expected Behavior
Given TICKET-018-05 findings (0/69 files have test functions):
- Coverage may be 0% or N/A for files without tests
- Tool should handle "no tests" gracefully
- May need to validate tool behavior, not coverage levels
- Focus on tool correctness, not coverage requirements

### Baseline Testing (Pre-Integration)
```bash
$ cd /home/noah/src/ruchy-book
$ ruchy coverage tests/extracted/ch03-00-functions-tdd_example_1.ruchy
```

**Expected Results**:
- Tool reports coverage status (may be 0% or N/A)
- Handles files without test functions gracefully
- Provides clear output about coverage status
- May discover tool behavior with no tests

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Complete Phase 1B**: Final tool in compilation/testing phase
2. **Coverage Tool Validation**: Ensure coverage reporting works correctly
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Add `ruchy coverage` to automated pipelines
4. **Tool Behavior Documentation**: Document how tool handles no tests

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 69 files analyzed for coverage
- [ ] Tool behavior documented (with/without tests)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline includes coverage check
- [ ] Clear understanding of coverage reporting
- [ ] Pattern refined for coverage tools

## EXTREME TDD Approach

### Phase 1: RED (Document Expected Behavior)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Files without tests: 0% coverage or N/A (expected)
- Files with tests: Coverage percentage reported
- Tool should handle both cases gracefully
- May need to focus on tool validation, not coverage levels

**Test Command**:
```bash
# Run baseline test on sample files
for file in tests/extracted/ch01-02-hello-world-tdd_example_1.ruchy \
            tests/extracted/ch02-00-variables-types-tdd_example_1.ruchy \
            tests/extracted/ch03-00-functions-tdd_example_1.ruchy; do
  echo "Testing: $file"
  ruchy coverage "$file" 2>&1 | head -5
done

# Test all files if individual tests work
make dogfood-coverage > logs/TICKET-018-17-baseline.log 2>&1 || \
  echo "Coverage tool baseline test"
```

**Success Criteria for RED Phase**:
- [ ] Baseline results documented
- [ ] Tool behavior understood (with/without tests)
- [ ] Expected output patterns identified
- [ ] Failures/limitations analyzed

### Phase 2: GREEN (Integration Implementation)

**Implementation Tasks**:

1. **Create Test Infrastructure**:
```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env -S deno run --allow-read --allow-run
/**
 * TICKET-018-17: Comprehensive ruchy coverage validation
 *
 * Validates that ruchy coverage correctly reports coverage metrics.
 * Part of 18-tool comprehensive testing initiative.
 * Phase 1B (Compilation & Testing) - Tool 3/3
 */

interface CoverageResult {
  file: string;
  hasCoverage: boolean;
  coveragePercent?: number;
  totalLines?: number;
  coveredLines?: number;
  error?: string;
  durationMs: number;
}

async function runRuchyCoverage(file: string): Promise<CoverageResult> {
  const startTime = performance.now();

  const cmd = new Deno.Command("ruchy", {
    args: ["coverage", file],
    stdout: "piped",
    stderr: "piped",
  });

  const { code, stderr, stdout } = await cmd.output();
  const durationMs = performance.now() - startTime;

  const stderrText = new TextDecoder().decode(stderr);
  const stdoutText = new TextDecoder().decode(stdout);
  const output = stdoutText + stderrText;

  // Parse coverage output
  const hasCoverage = !output.includes("no tests") &&
                      !output.includes("No coverage");

  // Try to extract coverage percentage
  const coverageMatch = output.match(/(\d+\.?\d*)%/);
  const coveragePercent = coverageMatch ?
    parseFloat(coverageMatch[1]) : undefined;

  return {
    file,
    hasCoverage,
    coveragePercent,
    error: code !== 0 ? output : undefined,
    durationMs,
  };
}

// Test all files, collect results, report coverage metrics
```

2. **Update CI/CD Pipeline**:
```yaml
# Add to .github/workflows/quality-gates.yml after test validation
- name: Coverage Reporting (ruchy coverage)
  run: |
    echo "üìä TICKET-018-17: Running coverage reporting..."
    total=0
    with_coverage=0
    without_coverage=0
    for file in tests/extracted/*.ruchy tests/ch*/*.ruchy; do
      if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        total=$((total + 1))
        result=$(ruchy coverage "$file" 2>&1)
        if echo "$result" | grep -q "no tests\|No coverage"; then
          without_coverage=$((without_coverage + 1))
        else
          with_coverage=$((with_coverage + 1))
        fi
      fi
    done
    echo "üìä Coverage Results:"
    echo "   Total files analyzed: $total"
    echo "   Files with coverage: $with_coverage"
    echo "   Files without coverage: $without_coverage"
    if [ $with_coverage -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "   ‚úÖ Tool correctly reports: No coverage (no tests)"
      echo "   üìù Expected: Codebase has no test functions"
    fi
    echo "‚úÖ Coverage reporting complete"
```

3. **Run Integration Test**:
```bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-run test/tools/test-ruchy-coverage.ts
```

- ‚úÖ Phase 1A complete (3/3 tools)
- ‚úÖ TICKET-018-02 complete (compile, 96.9%)
- ‚úÖ TICKET-018-05 complete (test, 100% accuracy)
- ‚úÖ Test infrastructure pattern proven

### Blockers (None Known)
- No known blockers

### Downstream Impact
- Completes Phase 1B (Compilation & Testing)
- Validates coverage tool quality
- Establishes pattern for coverage analysis
- Prepares for Phase 1C (next tooling phase)

## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios

1. **File without Tests**: Should report no coverage or 0%
   ```bash
   ruchy coverage tests/extracted/ch01-02-hello-world_example_1.ruchy
   # Expected: "No coverage" or "0%" (no test functions)
   ```

2. **File with Tests**: Should report coverage percentage
   ```bash
   # If any files have tests (unlikely based on TICKET-018-05)
   ruchy coverage [file_with_tests]
   # Expected: Coverage percentage
   ```

3. **All Files**: Comprehensive validation
   ```bash
   deno run --allow-read --allow-run test/tools/test-ruchy-coverage.ts
   # Expected: Report tool behavior across all files
   ```

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Pre-integration baseline
for file in tests/**/*.ruchy; do
  ruchy coverage "$file" 2>&1 | head -3
done > logs/TICKET-018-17-baseline.log

# Post-integration verification
deno run --allow-read --allow-run test/tools/test-ruchy-coverage.ts

# Verify tool behavior
ruchy coverage tests/extracted/ch03-00-functions-tdd_example_1.ruchy
```

## Comparison with Previous Phase 1B Tools

### TICKET-018-02 (Compilation)
- 96.9% pass rate (62/64 valid examples)
- 142ms avg per file, 9.8s total
- Real bugs discovered (2 transpilation issues)

### TICKET-018-05 (Testing)
- 100% accuracy (0/69 files with tests)
- 3ms avg per file, 199ms total
- Design pattern documented

### TICKET-018-17 (Coverage)
- Expected: Similar to testing (no tests = no coverage)
- Expected: 3-5ms avg per file
- Expected: Tool validation, not coverage requirements

### Key Difference
Coverage depends on tests existing. With 0/69 files having tests, coverage will likely be 0% or N/A. Focus on tool validation.

## Phase 1B Context

**Phase 1B Goal**: Validate code compilation and testing

**Three Tools**:
1. [x] TICKET-018-02: `ruchy compile` - Transpilation (96.9%)
