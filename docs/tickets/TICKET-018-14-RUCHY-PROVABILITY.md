# TICKET-018-14: Integrate `ruchy provability` - Formal Verification Scoring

**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (with bug filed)
**Priority**: P1 (High Priority - Phase 1D Continuation)
**Parent**: TICKET-018 (Comprehensive 18-Tool Testing)
**Phase**: Phase 1D (Performance & Analysis) - 2/3 ‚úÖ
**Predecessor**: TICKET-018-13 (ruchy runtime - COMPLETE, Phase 1D 1/3)
**Milestone**: 11/18 tools (61.1%) - Approaching 75%
**Actual Effort**: 30 minutes (incl. Five Whys, source code analysis, bug filing)
**Ruchy Version**: v3.169.0
**Bug Filed**: GitHub issue #99

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Tool Limitations Discovered

After systematic Five Whys analysis and debugging, `ruchy provability` is **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**:

### Working Features ‚úÖ
- Basic provability scoring (0.0 when no formal specs)
- Safety checks (unsafe operations, purity, side effects)
- Contract detection
- Bounds checking
- Termination analysis (basic)

### Broken/Not Implemented ‚ùå
- **Loop detection** (reports "No loops found" even when loops exist)
- **Verbose output** (flag has no effect)
- **Loop invariant analysis** (depends on broken loop detection)

**Implication**: All files will score 0.0/100 (EXPECTED, not a failure) because:
1. Our teaching examples lack formal verification annotations
2. Tool measures presence of formal specs, not code quality

**Debug Log**: `logs/provability-debug-findings.md`

## Executive Summary

Integrate `ruchy provability` formal verification analysis into the comprehensive testing pipeline. This is the **eleventh of 18 tools** and **continues Phase 1D** (Performance & Analysis). This tool performs basic safety analysis and reports provability scores. Due to tool limitations and lack of formal specs in teaching code, **all scores will be 0.0/100 (this is CORRECT behavior, not a failure)**.

## Current State

### What `ruchy provability` Does (In Theory)

The `ruchy provability` command performs formal verification analysis:
- Analyzes code for formal correctness
- Checks contracts (pre/post-conditions, invariants)
- Performs safety analysis (purity, side effects, unsafe ops)
- Provides provability scoring (0-100)
- Loop invariant checking
- Termination analysis
- Bounds checking

**Output**: Provability score (0-100), verification results

### What It Actually Does (After Debugging)

**Works**:
- Basic safety analysis (purity, side effects, unsafe operations)
- Contract detection (reports absence)
- Bounds checking (array safety)
- Termination analysis (reports all functions terminate)
- Exit code 0 on valid files

**Doesn't Work**:
- Loop detection (broken - reports no loops even when present)
- Verbose output (no effect)
- Non-zero scores (requires formal specs we don't have)

### Baseline Testing Results

**Summary**: 100% of files return 0.0/100 (EXPECTED)

```bash
$ ruchy provability tests/extracted/ch03-00-functions-tdd_example_1.ruchy
=== Provability Analysis ===
File: tests/extracted/ch03-00-functions-tdd_example_1.ruchy
Provability Score: 0.0/100

$ ruchy provability --verify tests/extracted/ch03-00-functions-tdd_example_1.ruchy
=== Provability Analysis ===
Provability Score: 0.0/100

=== Formal Verification ===
‚úì No unsafe operations detected
‚úì All functions are pure
‚úì No side effects found

$ ruchy provability --contracts tests/extracted/ch03-00-functions-tdd_example_1.ruchy
=== Contract Verification ===
No contracts defined
```

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Continue Phase 1D**: Second of three performance/analysis tools
2. **Baseline Establishment**: Document current provability state (all 0.0)
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Add `provability` to automated pipelines
4. **Tool Validation**: Verify tool runs successfully (not crash)
5. **Limitation Documentation**: Clearly document what works/doesn't

### Adjusted Success Criteria (Based on Reality)
- [ ] All 69 files analyzed (tool doesn't crash)
- [ ] Provability scores reported (expect all 0.0/100)
- [ ] Basic safety analysis works (verify flag output)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline includes provability
- [ ] Limitations documented clearly
- [ ] Phase 1D progressing (2/3 tools)

### NOT Success Criteria (Tool Limitations)
- ‚ùå Non-zero provability scores (requires formal specs)
- ‚ùå Loop invariant detection (loop detection broken)
- ‚ùå Verbose output (not implemented)

## EXTREME TDD Approach

### Phase 1: RED (Document Expected Behavior)

**Expected Behavior** (Adjusted for Reality):
- All files should analyze without crashing
- All scores will be 0.0/100 (correct for code without formal specs)
- Safety checks should pass
- Tool should report "No contracts defined"
- Exit code should be 0

**Test Command**:

1. **Create Test Infrastructure**:
```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env -S deno run --allow-read --allow-run
/**
 * TICKET-018-14: Comprehensive ruchy provability validation
 *
 * Validates formal verification and provability scoring.
 * Part of 18-tool comprehensive testing initiative.
 * Phase 1D (Performance & Analysis) - Tool 2/3

  file: string;
  success: boolean;
  score?: number;
  hasContracts?: boolean;
  safetyChecks?: {
    noUnsafeOps?: boolean;
    allPure?: boolean;
    noSideEffects?: boolean;
  };
  error?: string;
  durationMs: number;
}

async function runRuchyProvability(file: string): Promise<ProvabilityResult> {
  const startTime = performance.now();

  const cmd = new Deno.Command("ruchy", {
    args: ["provability", file],
    stdout: "piped",
    stderr: "piped",

  const { code, stderr, stdout } = await cmd.output();
  const durationMs = performance.now() - startTime;

  const stderrText = new TextDecoder().decode(stderr);
  const stdoutText = new TextDecoder().decode(stdout);
  const output = stdoutText + stderrText;

  // Parse provability score
  const scoreMatch = output.match(/Provability Score: ([0-9.]+)\/100/);
  const score = scoreMatch ? parseFloat(scoreMatch[1]) : undefined;

  return {

    success: code === 0,
    score,
    error: code !== 0 ? output : undefined,
    durationMs,
  };
}

// Test all files, report baseline, document limitations
```

2. **Update CI/CD Pipeline**:

    failed=0
    for file in tests/extracted/*.ruchy tests/ch*/*.ruchy; do
      if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        total=$((total + 1))
        if ruchy provability "$file" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
          success=$((success + 1))
        else
          failed=$((failed + 1))
        fi
      fi
    done
    echo "üî¨ Provability Results:"
    echo "   Total files: $total"
    echo "   Analyzed: $success"
    echo "   Failed: $failed"
    if [ $total -gt 0 ]; then
      pass_rate=$(awk "BEGIN {printf \"%.1f\", ($success / $total) * 100}")
      echo "   Success rate: ${pass_rate}%"
    fi
    echo "   Note: All scores 0.0/100 expected (no formal specs in teaching code)"
    if [ $success -eq $total ]; then
      echo "   ‚úÖ Excellent: 100% tool success (baseline established)"
    fi
    echo "‚úÖ Provability baseline complete"
```

3. **Run Integration Test**:

## Notes

### Why Integrate a Partially Working Tool?

**Reasons**:
1. **Baseline Establishment**: Document current state for future comparison
2. **Tool Evolution**: Ruchy is evolving - tool will improve
3. **Honest Documentation**: Show what works and what doesn't
4. **Complete Coverage**: Test ALL 18 tools, even imperfect ones
5. **Toyota Way**: Genchi Genbutsu - verify actual tool state
6. **Future Value**: When tool improves, we have baseline to compare

### What We Learn

**Value Despite Limitations**:
- Tool runs without crashing (stability)
- Basic safety analysis works (some value)
- Contract detection works (reports absence)
- Baseline for measuring future improvements
- Demonstrates honest, scientific approach

### Phase 1D Overview
**Performance & Analysis** (3 tools):
1. ‚úÖ ruchy runtime (performance & BigO) - COMPLETE
2. üöß ruchy provability (formal verification) - THIS TICKET
3. üîú ruchy bench (benchmarking) - Next

**Goal**: Establish performance and analysis baselines

---

**Status**: üî¨ Ready to complete RED phase (debugging done)
**Risk Level**: Medium (tool partially working, but won't crash)
**Expected Outcome**: Phase 1D 2/3, 11/18 tools (61.1%), provability baseline established

## üéâ COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Completed**: 2025-10-30
**Actual Time**: 30 minutes (Five Whys + source code analysis + bug filing + integration)
**Status**: ‚úÖ ALL SUCCESS CRITERIA MET + BUG DISCOVERED AND FILED

### Results Achieved

**Tool Success Performance**:
- Total files analyzed: 69/69 (100%)
- Tool success rate: 100% (no crashes)
- Provability scores: All 0.0/100 (EXPECTED due to confirmed bug)
- Performance: 3ms avg per file, 201ms total
- Tool reliability: 100% success across all files

**Bug Discovery (Five Whys + Source Code Analysis)**:
- **Root Cause Found**: `calculate_provability_score()` only counts `assert()` calls
- **Source File**: `../ruchy/src/bin/handlers/commands.rs`
- **Bug Formula**: `score = (assertion_count / total_statements) * 100`
- **Result**: 0 assertions ‚Üí 0.0/100 (even if code provably safe/pure/terminating)
- **GitHub Issue**: #99 filed with comprehensive evidence

**What Works vs What Doesn't**:
- ‚úÖ Tool runs without crashing (100%)
- ‚úÖ Formal verification analyses functional (`--verify`, `--bounds`, `--termination`)
- ‚úÖ Reports purity, safety, termination correctly
- ‚ùå Score calculation broken (only counts assertions)
- ‚ùå Loop detection broken (separate issue)
- ‚ùå Verbose output not functional

**Phase 1D PROGRESSING**:
- ‚úÖ Tool 1/3: ruchy runtime (performance & BigO)
- ‚úÖ Tool 2/3: ruchy provability (formal verification - baseline with bug)
- üîú Tool 3/3: ruchy bench (benchmarking - next)

**Overall Progress**:
- 11/18 tools (61.1%) - approaching 75% milestone!
- Phase 1A: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (3/3 tools)
- Phase 1B: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (3/3 tools)
- Phase 1C: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (3/3 tools)
- Phase 1D: üöÄ PROGRESSING (2/3 tools)

### Deliverables Completed

1. ‚úÖ **Five Whys Analysis**: Root cause identified via systematic investigation
2. ‚úÖ **Source Code Review**: Confirmed bug in `src/bin/handlers/commands.rs`
3. ‚úÖ **Bug Report**: Comprehensive documentation in `docs/bugs/`
4. ‚úÖ **GitHub Issue**: Filed #99 with evidence and reproduction steps
5. ‚úÖ **Baseline Testing**: 100% tool success confirmed
6. ‚úÖ **Test Infrastructure**: `test/tools/test-ruchy-provability.ts` created
7. ‚úÖ **CI/CD Integration**: Added provability with bug documentation
8. ‚úÖ **Documentation**: INTEGRATION.md and README.md updated

### Key Insights

**Scientific Approach Success**:
- Applied Five Whys when 0.0/100 scores seemed suspicious
- Read source code to confirm root cause
- Filed detailed bug report with evidence
- Proceeded with integration anyway (baseline value)

**Tool Assessment**:
- Infrastructure is solid (100% reliability)
- Scoring algorithm is buggy (design flaw)
- Formal verification analyses work correctly
- Baseline established for future comparison

**Value Despite Bug**:
- Tool runs reliably (no crashes)
- Provides safety/purity/termination analysis
- Baseline for measuring future improvements
- Bug documented and filed upstream
- Scientific approach validated

### What Worked Well

1. **Five Whys Methodology**: Found actual root cause, not surface symptoms
2. **Source Code Analysis**: Confirmed suspicions with evidence
3. **Bug Reporting**: Comprehensive GitHub issue filed
4. **Integration Anyway**: Baseline valuable even with bug
5. **Pattern Reuse**: Accelerated integration (30 min including debugging)

### Next Steps
