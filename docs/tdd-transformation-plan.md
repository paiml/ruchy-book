# TDD Book Transformation Plan

## Objective
Transform the Ruchy book from aspirational documentation to accurate, TDD-based content that only documents working features.

## Priority 1: Remove Completely Non-Working Chapters (0% success)
These chapters should be replaced with a single "Future Features" note:

1. **ch10-00-performance-optimization** - 0/11 working
2. **ch11-00-advanced-patterns** - 0/12 working  
3. **ch13-00-error-handling** - 0/12 working (different from ch07 TDD version)
4. **ch14-00-concurrency** - 0/13 working
5. **ch15-00-macros-metaprogramming** - 0/9 working
6. **ch16-00-testing-quality** - 0/11 working
7. **ch17-00-documentation** - 0/10 working
8. **ch18-00-deployment-devops** - 0/8 working
9. **ch19-00-real-world-projects** - 0/4 working
10. **ch20-00-tooling** - 0/6 working

## Priority 2: Fix Misleading Chapters (Low success rate)
These need major rewrites to show only working features:

1. **ch03-01-testing-functions** - 0/12 working
2. **ch05-00-data-processing** - 0/10 working
3. **ch06-00-file-operations** - 0/10 working  
4. **ch07-00-building-applications** - 0/9 working
5. **ch08-00-systems-programming** - 0/9 working
6. **ch09-00-network-programming** - 0/10 working
7. **ch12-00-traits-generics** - 0/11 working

## Priority 3: Enhance Working TDD Chapters
These already work and should be the foundation:

1. **ch01-02-hello-world-tdd** - 100% (6/6) ‚úÖ
2. **ch03-00-functions-tdd** - 89% (8/9) ‚úÖ
3. **ch10-00-input-output-tdd** - 70% (7/10) ‚úÖ
4. **ch02-00-variables-types-tdd** - 63% (5/8) ‚úÖ
5. **ch11-00-file-operations-tdd** - 60% (6/10) ‚úÖ
6. **ch05-00-control-flow-tdd** - 57% (8/14) ‚úÖ
7. **ch08-00-advanced-functions-tdd** - 56% (5/9) ‚úÖ

## New Chapter Structure Template

```markdown
# Chapter X: [Feature Name]

‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation Status**: [Working|Partial|Future]
‚úÖ **Test Coverage**: X/Y examples passing
üì¶ **Required Version**: Ruchy v1.10.0+

## What Actually Works

[List only features that pass tests]

## TDD Examples

### Example 1: [Specific working pattern]
```ruchy
// This code is tested and works
[actual working code]
```

### What Doesn't Work Yet

‚ùå Feature X - Planned for v2.0
‚ùå Feature Y - Not implemented
‚ùå Feature Z - Parsing only, no execution

## Test This Chapter

```bash
# Run the TDD test suite for this chapter
make test-chXX
```
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Mark Non-Working Chapters (TODAY)
1. Add clear "NOT IMPLEMENTED" banners to all 0% chapters
2. Move content to "future-features.md" appendix
3. Replace with stub explaining feature is planned

### Phase 2: Create TDD Tests (THIS WEEK)
1. Write test suites for each chapter's claimed features
2. Document what actually passes
3. Remove all failing examples

### Phase 3: Rewrite Content (NEXT WEEK)
1. Rewrite chapters using only passing tests
2. Add "What Works" and "What Doesn't" sections
3. Include test commands for verification

### Phase 4: Validation (ONGOING)
1. Every example must compile with current Ruchy
2. Every example must have expected output
3. CI must verify all examples on each commit

## Success Metrics

- **Before**: 19% examples working, misleading documentation
- **Target**: 100% of documented examples working
- **Method**: Only document what works, clearly mark future features
