notes: |
  This is a Test-Driven Documentation (TDD) project where every code example
  is automatically extracted and tested against the Ruchy compiler.

  The book serves as both:
  1. Learning resource for Ruchy developers
  2. Comprehensive test suite for the Ruchy compiler

  Quality is built-in, not bolted-on. Zero tolerance for broken examples.
