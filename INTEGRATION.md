## 📝 Verification Notes

### Dogfooding Results (v1.32.0)
- **ruchy check**: 59/80 files pass syntax validation (73.8%)
- **ruchy lint**: 59/80 files pass style analysis (73.8%)
- **ruchy fmt**: 0/80 files pass formatting (consistent with expectations)
- **ruchy score**: A+ quality score achieved (1.000/1.000)
- **ruchy provability**: Limited analysis capability on test files

### Key Findings
1. **Core functionality working**: Basic examples in Ch01-06 largely passing
2. **Advanced features failing**: Ch23 (REPL inspection) entirely non-functional
3. **Formatting tool issues**: ruchy fmt consistently fails on all files
4. **Strong quality metrics**: Despite failures, quality scoring remains high
