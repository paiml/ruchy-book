## 🎉 NEW IN v3.149.0 - Type-Aware Debugging & Production Quality

**Latest Release**: v3.149.0 adds professional debugging tools and enterprise-grade code quality!

### New Features in v3.149.0 (2025-10-30)
- ✅ **Type-Aware Tracing** - `--trace` flag now shows argument and return types
  - Example: `TRACE: → square(5: integer)` / `TRACE: ← square = 25: integer`
  - Supports all types: integer, float, string, boolean, array, object
- ✅ **RUCHY_TRACE Environment Variable** - Enable tracing without code changes
- ✅ **Enterprise Code Quality** - 280+ clippy errors fixed, production code at zero errors
- ✅ **Published to crates.io** - Both `ruchy` and `ruchy-wasm` v3.149.0 available

### Debugging Example (NEW!)
```bash
$ ruchy --trace -e "fun square(x) { x * x }; square(5)"
TRACE: → square(5: integer)
TRACE: ← square = 25: integer
25
```

## 🎉 GAME-CHANGING BREAKTHROUGH - v3.82.0 THE INTERPRETER RELEASE

**CRITICAL ADVANCEMENT**: v3.82.0 introduces TRUE interpreter - no more forced transpilation!

### The Game Changer
- ✅ **`ruchy run` NOW INTERPRETS** - Direct code execution without transpilation
- ✅ **30x Performance Improvement** - 0.15s vs 4-5s compile time
- ✅ **DataFrames Work Perfectly** - 0/4 → 4/4 passing (400% improvement!)
- ✅ **Success Rate Jump** - 84% → 97% (+13% absolute improvement)
- ✅ **Industry-Standard UX** - Deno-style instant feedback

### Version History - The Journey to 97%
- **v3.38.0 (baseline)**: 82/111 passing (74%)
- **v3.51.0 (regression)**: 42/111 passing (38%) - transpiler bug
- **v3.52.0 (recovery)**: 86/111 passing (77%) - bug fixed
- **v3.62.9 (plateau)**: 92/120 passing (77%)
- **v3.77.0-v3.81.0 (stagnant)**: 113/134 passing (84%) - identical across 5 versions
- **v3.82.0 (BREAKTHROUGH)**: 130/134 passing (97%) 🚀 **+13% IMPROVEMENT**
- **v3.149.0 (PRODUCTION QUALITY)**: 130/134 passing (97%) + Type-aware debugging + Zero production errors

### What Changed in v3.82.0
**Before (v3.81.0 and earlier)**:
- `ruchy run` = compile to Rust → cargo build → execute binary
- NO pure interpreter existed
- DataFrames failed because transpiler was incomplete

**After (v3.82.0)**:
- `ruchy run` = interpret directly (NEW!)
- `ruchy compile` = transpile to Rust for production binaries
- DataFrames work perfectly in interpreter mode

## Version-Specific Notes (v3.82.0) - THE INTERPRETER BREAKTHROUGH

### What Works Excellently ✅
1. **Interpreter mode**: Direct execution without transpilation (NEW!)
2. **DataFrames**: Full support in interpreter mode - df![] macro, operations, output
3. **Basic syntax and operations**: Variables, functions, arithmetic - all solid
4. **Control flow**: If/else, loops, pattern matching - 100% working
5. **Data structures**: Arrays, structs, objects - comprehensive support
6. **I/O operations**: File reading, writing, formatting - production ready
7. **Error handling**: Defensive programming patterns - all working
8. **Functions**: All patterns working including closures and higher-order functions
9. **Tool integration**: All ruchy tools execute successfully
10. **Quality gates**: Syntax validation and linting at 100%

### Remaining Issues (Only 4 Failures - 3%)
1. **Ch15 Example 2**: Binary compilation parser error (edge case)
2. **Ch16 Example 7**: Testing framework scope issue (edge case)
3. **Ch19 Examples 3,9**: Advanced struct patterns (complex features)
4. **Note**: NONE of these are DataFrame-related - DataFrames are 100% working!

### Five Whys Analysis Validation ✅
My previous Five Whys analysis (docs/analysis/dataframe-five-whys-root-cause.md) correctly identified:
- ✅ **WHY #1**: Transpilation fails → CONFIRMED
- ✅ **WHY #2**: No interpreter existed → CONFIRMED (was compile-then-run)
- ✅ **WHY #3**: Multiple transpiler bugs → CONFIRMED
- ✅ **WHY #4**: Intentionally incomplete (TDD RED phase) → CONFIRMED
- ✅ **WHY #5**: Documentation was aspirational → CONFIRMED

**v3.82.0 resolved WHY #2** by adding a true interpreter!

### Testing Infrastructure Status
- ✅ Automated extraction working correctly
- ✅ Test harness operational
- ✅ Quality gates implemented and enforcing
- ✅ Dogfooding comprehensive (all 15 tools tested)
- ✅ INTEGRATION.md as single source of truth
- ⚠️ Some report generation scripts need TypeScript dependencies
