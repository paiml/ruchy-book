## 📈 v1.57.0 Qualification Results

### 🔴 Major Concerns
- **136 total examples**: Only 69 passing (51%)
- **DataFrame Support**: Complete failure (0%)
- **Advanced Features**: Most below 30% pass rate
- **Regression**: -39.7% from v1.36.0

### Foundation Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING
- **Ch1-3**: Foundation chapters maintain ~85% average
- **Ch4**: Critical failure (10%)
- **Ch5-6**: Core programming at 91% average
- **Ch10+**: Advanced features severely degraded

### 🎯 Qualification: ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION

**Assessment**: ruchy 1.57.0 shows significant regression from v1.36.0. The 51% pass rate with complete DataFrame failure and advanced feature breakage makes this version unsuitable for production book publication.

---

## 🔮 Recommendations

1. **Revert to v1.36.0**: For production use
2. **File bug reports**: DataFrame support, error handling, I/O operations
3. **Focus on foundation**: Chapters 1-6 remain mostly functional
4. **Avoid advanced features**: Ch15-18 severely broken

---

**Final Status**: 🔴 **v1.57.0 NOT QUALIFIED - MAJOR REGRESSION**

*This qualification report documents severe regression in ruchy 1.57.0 with only 51% example success rate and complete DataFrame failure.*
