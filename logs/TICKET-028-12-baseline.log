🧬 TICKET-028-12: ruchy mutations Validation
🚀 Phase 2B: Medium Priority Tools (2/7)
================================================================================

📋 Test Configuration:
   Tool: ruchy mutations (mutation testing)
   Purpose: Validate test suite quality
   Expected: Generate mutations and check if tests catch them

🧪 Test 1: Basic Mutation Testing
   Success: ✅
   Mutations generated: 0
   Mutations killed: 0
   Mutations survived: 0
   Mutation score: 0.0%
   Execution time: 88.00ms

🧪 Test 2: Mutation Operator Detection
   Operators detected: 0
   • No specific operators detected (tool may use different format)

🧪 Test 3: File Without Tests (Expected Low Score)
   Success: ✅
   Mutations generated: 0
   Mutation score: 0.0%
   Expected: Low/zero score (no tests to catch mutations)

================================================================================
📊 Assessment Summary:

⚠️  ruchy mutations Status: PARTIAL FUNCTIONALITY

   Issues Found:
   • No mutations generated

   Performance Analysis:
   • Execution time: 88.00ms
   • Mutations generated: 0

   Comparison with other testing tools:
   • ruchy test: ~3ms (unit tests only)
   • ruchy property-tests: ~100ms (10 cases, automated)
   • ruchy mutations: 88.00ms (test quality validation)
   • Mutation testing: Validates if tests actually catch bugs

================================================================================
