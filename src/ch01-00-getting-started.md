# Getting Started

Let's get Ruchy installed and write our first program!

## Quick Start

The fastest way to try Ruchy is with the REPL:

```bash
$ ruchy repl
Ruchy 0.4.11 - Interactive REPL
>>> println("Hello, Ruchy!")
Hello, Ruchy!
```

In this chapter, we'll cover:
- Installing Ruchy on your system
- Writing your first Ruchy program
- Understanding how Ruchy works

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a working Ruchy installation and will have written, compiled, and run your first program.
