# Ruchy Development Roadmap

## Current State (v1.9.1)

### ✅ What Works Today

**Core Language (85-90% Complete)**
- Variables and types
- Functions with parameters/returns
- Control flow (if/else, loops, match)
- Basic I/O operations
- String manipulation methods
- Pipeline operator (|>)
- Import/export system
- Module organization

**Professional Tools (88% Working)**
- `ruchy check` - Type checking
- `ruchy lint` - Code quality
- `ruchy runtime` - Execution
- `ruchy provability` - Formal verification
- `ruchy score` - Quality metrics
- `ruchy quality-gate` - CI integration
- `ruchy test` - Test runner

### ⚠️ Partially Working

**Integration Patterns (15-20%)**
- Complex feature combinations
- Generic functions with constraints
- Error propagation chains
- Async with other features

**Standard Library (20-30%)**
- Basic collections
- Limited file I/O
- Missing utilities
- No network support

### ❌ Not Implemented

**Major Features**
- Concurrency/async
- Macros
- Full generics
- Traits
- Network programming
- Database connectivity
- Web frameworks

## Development Timeline

### v2.0 (Q2 2025)
**Focus: Standard Library & Error Handling**
- Complete Result/Option types
- File I/O improvements
- Basic collections (HashMap, etc.)
- Error propagation
- Documentation generation

### v2.5 (Q4 2025)
**Focus: Concurrency & Performance**
- Basic async/await
- Thread support
- Performance profiling
- Data processing pipelines
- Traits and bounded generics

### v3.0 (Q2 2026)
**Focus: Enterprise Features**
- Full macro system
- Network programming
- Database drivers
- Web framework
- Package manager

## How to Contribute

### Priority Areas
1. **Standard library functions** - Most needed
2. **Error handling patterns** - Critical gap
3. **Collection types** - HashMap, Set, etc.
4. **File I/O improvements** - Real-world needs
5. **Test coverage** - Quality assurance

### Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the compiler
git clone https://github.com/paiml/ruchy
cd ruchy

# Run tests
cargo test

# Build compiler
cargo build --release

# Test your changes
./target/release/ruchy your-test.ruchy
```

### Contribution Guidelines
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Follow Rust idioms
- Document public APIs
- Add integration tests
- Update this roadmap

## Success Metrics

### v2.0 Target
- Book examples: 40% working
- Standard library: 50% complete
- Integration patterns: 30% working

### v2.5 Target
- Book examples: 60% working
- Standard library: 70% complete
- Integration patterns: 50% working

### v3.0 Target
- Book examples: 80% working
- Standard library: 90% complete
- Integration patterns: 80% working

## Philosophy

**Quality over Quantity**: Better to have fewer features that work perfectly than many broken features.

**User-First**: Prioritize features that unblock real users over theoretical completeness.

**Toyota Way**: Every feature must be tested, documented, and validated before release.
