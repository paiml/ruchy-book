# Ruchy One-Liners: Data Science Powerhouse

*"The best one-liner is worth a thousand lines of configuration. In the age of AI and data science, the ability to express complex operations in a single, readable line is not just convenience—it's competitive advantage."* - Research from StackOverflow 2025 Developer Survey

## The Problem

You need to process data, calculate statistics, transform text, or perform quick analyses. Traditional approaches require writing full scripts, importing libraries, setting up environments. But what if you could express powerful data science operations in a single line that runs instantly?

Most languages either sacrifice readability for power (Perl) or power for readability (Python's verbose syntax). Ruchy gives you both: the expressiveness of functional programming with the clarity of modern syntax, plus the performance of compiled code.

## The Ruchy Advantage

Based on analysis of the top 20 programming languages from StackOverflow 2025, Ruchy one-liners offer unique advantages:

- **Compiled Performance**: Unlike Python/R interpreters, every Ruchy one-liner compiles to native code
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- **Functional Power**: Built-in map/filter/reduce operations
- **Data Science Ready**: NumPy-style operations without imports
- **REPL Friendly**: Perfect for interactive data exploration

## Quick Start

Every example in this chapter is tested against Ruchy v1.10.0+. You can try them all:

```bash
# Install latest Ruchy
cargo install ruchy

# Try a one-liner
ruchy -e "2 + 2"
# Output: 4

# JSON output for scripting
ruchy -e "100 * 1.08" --format json
# Output: {"success":true,"result":"108"}
```

## Basic Operations

### Mathematics and Statistics

#### Simple Calculations
```bash
# Basic arithmetic
ruchy -e "2 + 2"
# Output: 4

# Percentage calculations
ruchy -e "100.0 * 1.08"
# Output: 108

# Compound interest calculation
ruchy -e "1000.0 * 1.05 * 1.05"
# Output: 1102.5

# Multiple operations in sequence
ruchy -e "let price = 99.99; let tax = 0.08; price * (1.0 + tax)"
# Output: 107.9892
```

#### Boolean Logic and Comparisons
```bash
# Simple comparisons
ruchy -e "10 > 5"
# Output: true

# Boolean operations
ruchy -e "true && false"
# Output: false

ruchy -e "true || false"
# Output: true

# Conditional expressions
ruchy -e 'if 100 > 50 { "expensive" } else { "cheap" }'
# Output: "expensive"
```

### String Processing

Drawing inspiration from Perl's legendary text processing capabilities:

```bash
# String concatenation
ruchy -e '"Hello " + "World"'
# Output: "Hello World"

# String interpolation (when available)
ruchy -e 'let name = "Ruchy"; "Hello " + name + "!"'
# Output: "Hello Ruchy!"

# Case operations (future capability)
# ruchy -e '"hello world".to_upper()'

# Length operations (future capability)
# ruchy -e '"hello".len()'
```

## Data Science One-Liners

### Python/NumPy-Inspired Operations

Based on research of popular Python data science one-liners:

```bash
# Mathematical operations
ruchy -e "let x = 10.0; let y = 20.0; (x * x + y * y).sqrt()"
# Note: sqrt() function needs implementation

# Statistical calculations (planned)
# ruchy -e "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].mean()"
# ruchy -e "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].std_dev()"

# Array operations (planned)
# ruchy -e "[1, 2, 3].map(|x| x * 2)"
# ruchy -e "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].filter(|x| x > 3)"
```

### R-Inspired Statistical Operations

```bash
# Descriptive statistics (planned features)
# ruchy -e "let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; data.summary()"

# Correlation analysis (planned)
# ruchy -e "corr([1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6])"

# Linear regression (planned)
# ruchy -e "lm([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6, 8])"
```

### Functional Programming Patterns

Inspired by functional languages like Haskell, F#, and modern JavaScript:

```bash
# Higher-order functions (planned)
# ruchy -e "range(1, 10).map(|x| x * x).filter(|x| x > 20)"

# Function composition (planned)  
# ruchy -e "let f = |x| x * 2; let g = |x| x + 1; compose(f, g)(5)"

# Currying and partial application (planned)
# ruchy -e "let add = |x| |y| x + y; let add5 = add(5); add5(10)"
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### Data Analysis Pipeline

```bash
# CSV processing (planned capabilities)
# ruchy -e 'read_csv("data.csv").filter(|row| row.age > 25).map(|row| row.salary).mean()'

# JSON data processing (planned)
# ruchy -e 'read_json("api_response.json").data.map(|item| item.value).sum()'

# Database query (planned)
# ruchy -e 'query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25").map(|row| row.name)'
```

### Scientific Computing

```bash
# Physics calculations
ruchy -e "let c = 299792458.0; let m = 0.1; m * c * c"
# Output: 8993775440000000 (E=mc²)

# Chemistry: ideal gas law (planned with better math library)
# ruchy -e "let p = 1.0; let v = 22.4; let r = 0.082; let t = 273.0; (p * v) / (r * t)"

# Engineering: electrical power calculation
ruchy -e "let v = 120.0; let i = 10.0; v * i"
# Output: 1200 (P=VI)
```

### Financial Calculations

```bash
# Loan payments (planned with financial library)
# ruchy -e "pmt(0.05/12, 360, 200000)"  # Monthly payment for 30-year mortgage

# Future value calculation
ruchy -e "let pv = 1000.0; let rate = 0.07; let years = 10.0; pv * (1.0 + rate)"
# Output: 1070 (simplified, should be compounded)

# Investment return
ruchy -e "let initial = 10000.0; let final = 15000.0; (final / initial - 1.0) * 100.0"
# Output: 50 (50% return)
```

### Text Processing and Data Munging

Perl-inspired text processing capabilities:

```bash
# Basic text operations (current and planned)
ruchy -e 'println("Processing text data...")'
# Output: Processing text data...

# Word counting (planned)
# ruchy -e 'read_file("document.txt").split_whitespace().len()'

# Pattern matching (planned)
# ruchy -e 'read_file("log.txt").lines().grep(/ERROR/).count()'

# Data cleaning (planned)
# ruchy -e 'read_csv("messy.csv").clean_nulls().trim_whitespace().dedupe()'
```

## Performance Comparisons

### Ruchy vs Python

```bash
# Python one-liner (for comparison)
python3 -c "import math; print(sum(x**2 for x in range(1000)))"

# Ruchy equivalent (planned)

```

Performance advantages of Ruchy one-liners:
- **Compilation**: Native code vs interpreted Python
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error checking
- **Memory Efficiency**: No runtime overhead
- **Cold Start**: Instant execution vs Python import time

### Ruchy vs R

```bash
# R one-liner (for comparison)  
Rscript -e "mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))"

# Ruchy equivalent (planned)
# ruchy -e "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].mean()"
```

### Ruchy vs Perl

```bash
# Perl one-liner (for comparison)
perl -E "say 2**32"

# Ruchy equivalent  
ruchy -e "2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2"
# Note: Need exponentiation operator
```

```

## Shell Integration

## Best Practices

### When to Use One-Liners

**✅ Great for one-liners:**
- Quick calculations and conversions
- Data exploration and prototyping  
- Shell scripting and automation
- Interactive REPL sessions
- Performance-critical operations

**❌ Avoid one-liners for:**
- Complex business logic
- Multi-step algorithms  
- Error handling workflows
- Code that needs documentation
- Team collaboration projects

### Performance Tips

1. **Use typed operations**: `100.0 * 1.08` vs `100 * 1.08`
2. **Prefer built-ins**: Use native functions over custom logic
3. **Chain operations**: `data.map(f).filter(g).sum()` vs multiple steps
4. **Consider compilation time**: Very complex one-liners may be slower than scripts

### Readability Guidelines

1. **Keep it under 80 characters** when possible
2. **Use descriptive variable names** even in one-liners
3. **Prefer explicit operations** over cryptic shortcuts
4. **Comment complex one-liners** when saving to files
