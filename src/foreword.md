# Foreword

Welcome to The Ruchy Programming Language book. This is not just another programming language tutorial - it's a living, breathing document that evolves with the language itself.

## Our Philosophy

Ruchy was born from a simple observation: modern programming languages often sacrifice simplicity for power, or ease of use for performance. We believe you shouldn't have to choose.

Ruchy brings together:
- The simplicity of Python
- The performance of Rust  
- The expressiveness of functional programming
- The practicality of systems programming

## Implementation-First Documentation

Every code example in this book:
- Compiles with the current Ruchy compiler
- Is tested automatically in our CI pipeline
- Produces the exact output shown
- Can be copied and run immediately

We don't document features that don't exist. We don't make promises about future functionality. What you see is what works, today.

## How to Use This Book

This book is organized in progressive levels:

1. **Start with Level 0** if you want to write scripts quickly
2. **Continue to Level 1** when you need to build applications
3. **Advance to Level 2** for systems programming
4. **Explore Level 3** for language mastery

You don't need to read every chapter. Pick the level that matches your goals and dive in.

## A Living Document

This book is synchronized with the Ruchy compiler. When new features are added to the language, they appear here. When behaviors change, the examples update. This is not a snapshot - it's a mirror of the current implementation.

Let's begin your journey with Ruchy.
