# Appendix E: Learning Resources

*"Learning never stops. The best programmers are eternal students, always curious, always growing."* - Noah Gift

## Current Status

**⚠️ Important:** Ruchy is an experimental language in early development. Most traditional learning resources don't exist yet.

## Actual Available Resources

### Official Sources
- **This Book**: You're reading it - the primary documentation for Ruchy
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy - The source code and compiler
- **Ruchy Book Repository**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy-book - This book's source

### What Actually Exists
1. **The Ruchy Compiler**: A transpiler from Ruchy to Rust
2. **This Documentation**: The book you're currently reading
3. **Example Code**: Some examples in the compiler repository
4. **Grammar Specification**: Located at `docs/architecture/grammer.md` in the compiler repo

## Learning Approach

Since Ruchy transpiles to Rust, the best way to understand Ruchy is to:

### 1. Learn Rust First
Ruchy compiles to Rust, so understanding Rust is essential:
- **The Rust Programming Language Book**: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- **Rust by Example**: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/
- **Rustlings**: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings

### 2. Study the Ruchy Grammar
Read the grammar specification to understand Ruchy's syntax:
```bash
# In the Ruchy compiler repository
cat docs/architecture/grammer.md
```

### 3. Experiment with Transpilation
See how Ruchy code becomes Rust:
```bash
# Write Ruchy code
echo 'fun main() { println("Hello") }' > test.ruchy

# Transpile to Rust
ruchy transpile test.ruchy -o test.rs

# Examine the generated Rust code
cat test.rs
```

## Related Technologies

Since Ruchy builds on Rust concepts, these resources are relevant:

- [ ] More comprehensive examples
- [ ] Video tutorials

## Getting Help

### Current Support Channels
- **GitHub Issues**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy/issues - Report bugs or ask questions
- **Source Code**: Study the compiler implementation for deep understanding

### Understanding Error Messages
Since Ruchy transpiles to Rust, you'll often see Rust error messages:
1. Transpilation errors from Ruchy compiler
2. Rust compilation errors from rustc
3. Runtime errors from the generated binary

## Recommended Learning Path

1. **Week 1-2**: Learn Rust basics if you haven't already
2. **Week 3**: Study this Ruchy book thoroughly
3. **Week 4**: Read the Ruchy grammar specification
4. **Week 5**: Write simple Ruchy programs and study the transpiled Rust
5. **Week 6+**: Contribute to the Ruchy compiler or documentation

## Important Reminders

1. **Experimental**: Ruchy is experimental and changing
2. **Limited Resources**: Most traditional learning resources don't exist
3. **Rust Knowledge Required**: Understanding Rust is essential
4. **Community Building**: You're an early adopter helping build the community

## Conclusion

Learning Ruchy at this stage means being a pioneer. You're not just learning a language; you're helping shape it. The lack of traditional resources is an opportunity to contribute and create the resources future learners will use.

Remember: Every expert was once a beginner, and every established language was once experimental.
