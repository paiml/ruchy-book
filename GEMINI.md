# Gemini Project Context

This document provides context for the Gemini AI assistant to understand the Ruchy Book project.

## Project Overview

This project is the official book for the Ruchy programming language, developed with a strict **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology. All code examples are first written as tests and verified before being included in the documentation. The book is built using `mdbook`.

The core philosophy is: "Test first, document what works, never promise what doesn't exist."

## Technology Stack

*   **Ruchy (`ruchy`):** The programming language being documented. The project is pinned to a specific version of the `ruchy` compiler.
*   **mdBook (`mdbook`):** A utility to create books from Markdown files. Used to build the final HTML version of the book.
*   **Rust:** The integration test suite that validates all Ruchy code examples is written in Rust. `Cargo.toml` defines the testing dependencies.
*   **Deno:** Used for scripting various development and workflow tasks, such as extracting examples, running tests, and generating reports. Configuration is in `deno.json`.

## Development Workflow

The development process is centered around `make` and `deno` tasks.

### Key Commands

*   **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
*   **Build the book:**
    ```bash
    mdbook build
    ```
*   **Serve the book locally:**
    ```bash
    mdbook serve
    ```
*   **Run lint checks:**
    ```bash
    make dogfood-quick
    ```
*   **Run Deno-based scripts:**
    ```bash
    deno task <task_name>
    ```
    (e.g., `deno task test-oneliners`, `deno task extract-examples`)

### TDD Process for New Content

1.  **Write a test:** Add a new `.ruchy` file in the `tests/` directory.
2.  **Verify the test:** Run the test to ensure it works as expected.
3.  **Document the feature:** Add the explanation and code to a Markdown file in `src/`.
4.  **Validate:** Run `make validate` to ensure all checks pass.

## Project Structure

*   `src/`: Contains the Markdown source files for the book's chapters.
*   `tests/`: Contains the Ruchy code examples, which double as integration tests.
*   `book/`: The output directory for the built book (generated by `mdbook`).
*   `scripts/`: Deno scripts for automation (testing, linting, reports).
*   `book.toml`: `mdbook` configuration file.
*   `Cargo.toml`: Rust project file for the test harness.
*   `deno.json`: Deno configuration and task definitions.
*   `Makefile`: Defines the main entry points for development tasks.
*   `INTEGRATION.md`: The single source of truth for project status, test results, and quality metrics.
